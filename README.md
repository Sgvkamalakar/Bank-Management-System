A Bank Management System is a software application that enables bank managers to manage and monitor their branch's operations efficiently. 
The system provides a user-friendly interface that allows managers to view and track transactions made on a particular date and all account holders in their branch.

The Bank Management System has several key features that help bank managers perform their daily duties effectively. 
The first feature is the ability to view all the transactions made on a specific date. Managers can access this information by selecting a date range,
and the system will display all the transactions made during that period. This feature helps managers track the flow of money in and out of their branch, 
identify fraudulent activities, and make informed decisions about their branch's financial health.

The second feature of the Bank Management System is the ability to view all account holders in the branch. This feature enables managers 
to see a comprehensive list of all the customers who have accounts with the bank. The manager can view individual account details, such as account balances, 
transaction histories, and other relevant information. This feature allows managers to identify potential high-value customers and monitor account activity 
for suspicious behavior.

Overall, the Bank Management System is a valuable tool for bank managers to monitor their branch's operations and make informed decisions.
By providing real-time access to critical financial information, the system empowers managers to identify issues quickly, prevent fraudulent activities, 
and make informed decisions about their branch's financial health.
